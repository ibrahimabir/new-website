                <p>IBA, University of Dhaka</p>
                <p>My lessons at IBA started in the classrooms and grew into something much bigger- what started off as
                    business hacks from the teachers grew into life and survival hacks from my friends. I participated
                    in numerous competitions, won a few, lost many, and learnt a lot- especially from the failures. The
                    wins taught me the result of hard work, and the losses turned out to be chances to improve and
                    adapt.</p>
